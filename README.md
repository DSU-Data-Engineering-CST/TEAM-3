## Prerequisites ‚öôÔ∏è

1.  **Python:** Version 3.7 or higher installed.
2.  **pip:** Python package installer (usually comes with Python).
3.  **Google Cloud Account:** Required to access Google Cloud services.
4.  **Enabled YouTube Data API v3:** You need to create a project in Google Cloud Console, enable the "YouTube Data API v3", and generate credentials.
5.  **API Key:** Generate an API Key credential within your Google Cloud project for the YouTube Data API v3.
    *   **Important:** Keep your API Key secure! Do not commit it to version control.
    *   **API Quotas:** Be aware of the YouTube Data API's daily quota limits. Fetching data, especially comments for popular videos, consumes quota points. Check your usage in the Google Cloud Console.

## Installation & Setup üöÄ

1.  **Clone the Repository (or Download Files):**
    ```bash
    # If using Git
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd youtube_etl_project
    ```
    Or download the necessary files (`youtube_app.py`, `.gitignore`, `.env.example`, `README.md`) into a project directory.

2.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**
    (Highly recommended to keep dependencies isolated)
    ```bash
    # Navigate to your project directory in the terminal
    cd path/to/youtube_etl_project

    # Create a virtual environment named 'venv'
    python -m venv venv

    # Activate the virtual environment:
    # Windows (cmd):
    venv\Scripts\activate.bat
    # Windows (PowerShell):
    # (You might need to run: Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process)
    venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    # macOS / Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
    Your terminal prompt should now indicate the active environment (e.g., `(venv) C:\...`).

3.  **Create `requirements.txt` (if it doesn't exist):**
    Make sure you have the following lines in a file named `requirements.txt`:
    ```txt
    streamlit
    google-api-python-client
    pandas
    openpyxl
    ```

4.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    # Make sure your virtual environment is active!
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Configuration üîë

This Streamlit application primarily takes the **API Key** as direct input in the web interface sidebar for security reasons (it's not stored persistently).

While the `.env.example` file exists from potential earlier versions, it's not strictly necessary for running the `youtube_app.py` script, as the key is entered manually in the UI.

**Security Reminder:**
*   **NEVER** hardcode your API key directly into the `youtube_app.py` script.
*   **NEVER** commit your actual API key to Git or share it publicly.
*   Add `.env` (if you create one for other purposes) to your `.gitignore` file.

## Usage ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

1.  **Ensure Virtual Environment is Active:** If you open a new terminal, reactivate the venv (`source venv/bin/activate` or `venv\Scripts\activate`).
2.  **Run the Streamlit App:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run youtube_app.py
    ```
3.  **Open in Browser:** Streamlit will provide a local URL (usually `http://localhost:8501`). Open this URL in your web browser.
4.  **Interact with the UI:**
    *   Enter your **YouTube Data API v3 Key** in the sidebar field.
    *   Enter the **YouTube Video URL or just the Video ID** in the corresponding field.
    *   **Select** which data points (Views, Likes, Comments) you want to fetch using the checkboxes.
    *   Optionally, set **Start Date** and **End Date** filters for comments.
    *   Click the **"üöÄ Fetch Data"** button.
5.  **View Results:** The app will show status messages, display fetched metrics (Views, Likes, Comments Count), and a preview table of the comments (if fetched and filtered).
6.  **Download Data:** Use the "Download Stats (.txt)" and "Download Comments (.json)" buttons to save the results locally. The comment file will contain the data *after* date filtering has been applied.

## Output Files üìÑ

When you use the download buttons in the Streamlit app:

*   **`[VideoID]_stats.txt`**: A simple text file containing:
    *   Video Title
    *   Video ID
    *   Views (if fetched)
    *   Likes (if fetched)
*   **`[VideoID]_comments_filtered.json`**: A JSON file containing an array of comment objects. Each object includes details like `comment_id`, `author`, `published_at`, `comment_text`, `like_count`, etc. This file reflects any date filtering applied in the UI.

## Troubleshooting üõ†Ô∏è

*   **`streamlit: The term 'streamlit' is not recognized...`**:
    *   **Cause:** Streamlit is not installed OR your virtual environment is not active.
    *   **Fix:** Activate your venv (`source venv/bin/activate` or `venv\Scripts\activate`) and ensure you've run `pip install -r requirements.txt` within the active environment.
*   **`CRITICAL Unexpected Error: [WinError 10060] A connection attempt failed...`**:
    *   **Cause:** Network timeout connecting to Google's API servers. Often due to firewall blocking, proxy server issues, unstable internet, or (rarely) Google server problems.
    *   **Fix:** Check internet connection, temporarily disable firewall (for testing ONLY, then configure rules), configure proxy settings if needed (via `HTTP_PROXY`/`HTTPS_PROXY` environment variables), check DNS.
*   **`API Error (403): Forbidden` / `quotaExceeded`**:
    *   **Cause:** You've exceeded your daily YouTube Data API quota, or the API key doesn't have permission (ensure API is enabled in Google Cloud Console).
    *   **Fix:** Wait until the quota resets (usually midnight Pacific Time), request a quota increase (if needed), or check API key/project settings.
*   **`API Error (400): Bad Request` / `invalidKey`**:
    *   **Cause:** The API Key you entered is incorrect or invalid.
    *   **Fix:** Double-check the API Key value you entered. Ensure it was copied correctly from the Google Cloud Console.
*   **`Error: Video with ID 'https://...' not found`**:
    *   **Cause:** You pasted the full URL into the Video ID field when only the ID (the part after `v=`) was expected (though the current app version tries to handle this).
    *   **Fix:** Ensure you are providing either the correct full URL or just the 11-character Video ID (e.g., `dQw4w9WgXcQ`).
*   **Date Filtering Issues**: Ensure comment dates are parsed correctly. The YouTube API uses ISO 8601 format. If filtering seems off, check the date parsing logic in the `filter_comments_by_date` function.
